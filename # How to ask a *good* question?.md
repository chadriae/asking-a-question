# How to ask a *good* question?


We divided this into 4 chronological categories: before you ask the question, formulating the question, expecting an answer and what you still might need after asking the question.

## Before asking a question
<i>Steps taken before you ask a question. a preparation will help not only you but the others a geat deal.</i>
<ul>
    <li><b>Do your own research</b></li>
    <ul><li>Try to find the answer to your questions by yourself first, not only is it better to momorize. but you might also be suprised how much you can find by yourself</li></ul> 
    <ul><li>If you went from “something’s not working” to “asking a question” in less than 10 minutes, you probably haven’t done enough research</li></ul> 
    <li><b>Be prepared on the subject</b></li> 
    <ul><li>When asking a question, be prepared, have all the information you have at hand, analyse your situation/problem. Not only will this facilitate the process for you, but also for the person helping you</li></ul>
    <li><b>Read the room</b></li>
    <ul><li>Make sure you're asking questions at the right time. Not everyone is able to drop everything the moment you ask for something. People have other stuff to do, and that's okay.</li></ul>
</ul>

## Asking a question
<i>Things to take into account when you are about to ask the question.</i>
<ul>
    <li><b>Read the room</b></li>
    <ul><li>Make sure you're asking questions at the right time. Not everyone is able to drop everything the moment you ask for something. People have other stuff to do, and that's okay.</li></ul>
</ul> 

## The answer
<ul>
    <li>is it the answer you were looking for?
    <li>don't be content with one answer, confirm the answer by comparing it with others if possible
    <li>don't expect those who answer your question to solidify a perfect answer or solution within one answer/sentence. (See: have all your information at hand to  facilitate the process, be ready to answer a followup question)
</ul>

## After the question
<ul>
    <li>when the answer is not exactly what you need, answer with a more specific question based on the reply to your first question
    <li>don't expect those who answer your question to solidify a perfect answer or solution within one answer/sentence. (See: have all your information at hand to  facilitate the process, be ready to answer a followup question)
    <li>if the answer raises more questions or suggests trying something you haven't done before: Try using the feedback first before asking other questions
</ul>
