# How to ask a *good* question?


We divided this into 4 chronological categories: before you ask the question, formulating the question, expecting an answer and what you still might need after asking the question.

## Before asking a question:
<ul>
    <li><b>Do your own research</b></li>
    <ul><li>Try to find the answer to your questions by yourself first, not only is it better to momorize. but you might also be suprised how much you can find by yourself.</li></ul> 
    <li><b>Be prepared on the subject</b></li> 
    <ul><li>Have all your information at hand to facilitate the process</li></ul>
    <li><b>If you went from “something’s not working” to “asking a question” in less than 10 minutes, you probably haven’t done enough research.</b></li>

</ul>

## Asking a question:
<ul>
    <li>read the question to yourself: is the question clear to you? are you asking what you want to know?
    <li>give the others an idea on what you already tried/have done
    <li>be clear with your terminology, use the correct wording/terms
    <li>give the information others need to answer your question, but don't give too much (unnessesairy) information
</ul> 

## The answer:
<ul>
    <li>is it the answer you were looking for?
    <li>don't be content with one answer, confirm the answer by comparing it with others if possible
    <li>don't expect those who answer your question to solidify a perfect answer or solution within one answer/sentence. (See: have all your information at hand to  facilitate the process, be ready to answer a followup question)
</ul>

## After the question:
<ul>
    <li>when the answer is not exactly what you need, answer with a more specific question based on the reply to your first question
    <li>don't expect those who answer your question to solidify a perfect answer or solution within one answer/sentence. (See: have all your information at hand to  facilitate the process, be ready to answer a followup question)
    <li>if the answer raises more questions or suggests trying something you haven't done before: Try using the feedback first before asking other questions
</ul>
