# How to ask a *good* question?


We divided this into 4 chronological categories: before you ask the question, formulating the question, expecting an answer and what you still might need after asking the question.

## Before asking a question
<i>Steps taken before you ask a question. A good preparation will help not only yourself, but the others as well.</i>
<ul>
    <li><b>Do your own research</b></li>
    <ul><li>Try to find the answer to your questions by yourself first, not only is it better to momorize. but you might also be suprised how much you can find by yourself</li></ul> 
    <ul><li>If you went from “something’s not working” to “asking a question” in less than 10 minutes, you probably haven’t done enough research</li></ul> 
    <li><b>Be prepared on the subject</b></li> 
    <ul><li>When asking a question, be prepared, have all the information you have at hand, analyse your situation/problem. Not only will this facilitate the process for you, but also for the person helping you</li></ul>
    <li><b>Read the room</b></li>
    <ul><li>Make sure you're asking questions at the right time. Not everyone is able to drop everything the moment you ask for something. People have other stuff to do, and that's okay.</li></ul>
</ul>

## Asking a question
<i>Things to take into account when you are about to ask the question.</i>
<ul>
    <li><b>Double-check</b></li>
    <ul><li>You are about to share your question. Make sure that you have indeed asked the question you want asnwered. otherwise it might become a bit confusing.</li></ul>
   <ul><li>To avoid confusion, it will be important that you use the correct terms in your question. The devil lies in the details!</li></ul>
   <li><b>Too much information</b></li>
    <ul><li>It's recommended to start with some basic context info in your question. If that's not enough, you can add more specific info per request of the person helping you.</li></ul>
   <ul><li>Be careful not to give too much info at once, it will confuse others.</li></ul>
   <li><b>Share what you tried</b></li>
    <ul><li>It will be a lot easier for others to help when they can have an idea on what you have already tried. this will also prevent unnessesairy waste of time on both sides and more importantly: it could be helpfull in finding the solution.
    </li></ul>
</ul> 

## The answer
<i>OMG! You got an answer!</i>
<ul>
    <li><b>Correct? Or not?</b></li>
    <ul><li>Now that you have an answer, but you are not done yet... Be sure to check if the answer really is an anwer to your questions.</li></ul>
    <li><b>Affirmative!</b></li>
    <ul><li>Confirm the answer by comparing it with others if possible. don't take the first, best answer as truth! Be sceptic!
</li></ul>

</ul>

## After the question
<i>There is more? If you still haven't found what you were looking for...</i>
<ul>
    <li><b>Be more specific</b></li>
    <ul><li>If the answer is not what you are looking for, you can try to be more specific in your questioning, try wording it otherwise so that it may become clearer to your helper what you are asking. </li></ul>
      <li><b>Follow-up</b></li>
    <ul><li>One answer might not be enough to help you with what you need. Be ready to ask follow up questions (see: by having all your info at hand for example)</li></ul>
</ul>
